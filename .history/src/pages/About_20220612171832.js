                Some summers I watched over 1000 advertising commericals. The

              <p>
                From a young age I'we <b>made and played music.</b> I picked up
                the <b>guitar</b> at the age of 10 thanks to Angus Young who was
                my big idol. In high school I started my first band, and since
                then <b>music has been a big part of my life.</b> When I turned
                30 I decided I had to try to make it in the music industry and
                started a band called <b>Putte & Höket.</b> We got a{' '}
                <b>record deal</b> and released an album and a couple of singles
                and{' '}
                <b>toured as a supporting act to Stiftelsen and Hoffmaestro</b>{' '}
                at a couple of occations. I'we dedicated my life for 10 years
                but at the age of 40 I came to the conclusion that it's hard to
                make a living of it in Sweden, so I decided to just keep it as a
                hobby. I <b>still write music</b> for myself and other artists,
                and in the near future some songs will be released which I
                created. So music will allways be a part of my life.

                As a part of the frontend development education at KYH I had an{' '}

                So now I got the chance to <b>apply the skills </b> that I'we
                learned and to see if it was something for me. Oh yes it was.
                For me, my internship at Aline has been{' '}

                  real projects and learned to take responsibility and deliver a

                  improving the user experience on Aline's website.
                </b>{' '}
                I did a<b className='bolder'> thorough UX analysis</b> of the

                To understand the user and see the needs for improvemnts, I did
                several <b>user testings</b> in the form of interviews. Then I
                compiled the results and presented the findings and apllied them
                to the website. I also had the chance to work quite broadly with
                <b>several other types of tasks.</b> Among other things, I have
                on a daily basis <b>participated in many workshops,</b> where we

                improving various features in the app. I also helped with{' '}
                <b>layout and design tasks. </b> So it has been broad and very
