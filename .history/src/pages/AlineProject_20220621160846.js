            <p className='explainerText'>
              Aline is a startup within EdTech (Educational Technology). Their
              service is an App that is a platform for more effective learning.
              <br /> In the first half of 2022 I did my intership at Aline as a
              UX-designer, as a part of the 2 year frontend development
              education at KYH in Stockholm. We had UX-design courses in the
              frontend education and I really got hooked, and decided early on
              that I wanted to proceed a career within UX. My first task at
              Aline was to do a UX analysis of thier exisitng website.
              {/* The value the app gives users is that they learn more effectively
              to reach their goals faster. Users are professionals in their
              professions but want to develop further (upskill or reskill). Some
              of the functions in the app are, for example, to browse content
              within a specific area, add new content, set their learning goals
              and follow their development to achieve these goals. */}

        <p className='ingressParagraph'>
          The first part of the research was for me to learn more about Aline,
          their concept and vision, to get a better understanding of what they
          needed to communicate and to who. <br /> I talked to the stakeholder,
          marketing strategist and employees and read the companies
          documentation in order to learn more about thier brand, marketing
          plan, USP and what they wanted to say. With my new knowledge and
          insights I started to create a user test for the website.

              Some of the feedback from the stakeholder (COO) was that the
              website needed a clearer message and to be more simple in its
              approach. Afer testing the website myself I agreed with her. I
              felt a user test would be a effective way to get valuble insight
              from the target group. So I decided to do a user test.
