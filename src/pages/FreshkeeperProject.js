            <h3>Sustainable food consumption</h3>
            <p>
              More and more people are beginning to realize the importance of
              developing more sustainable services and functions that do not
              deplete ecosystem resources. Identify a problem with food
              consumption that you want to explore further and that you would
              like to solve in some way.
            </p>
            <h3>Assignment description</h3>
            <p>
              Develop a solution proposal in the form of a clickable prototype.
              The proposal must be rooted in business goals and user needs of
              the main target group. The prototype will primarily be used on
              mobile phones. The prototype should cover the main flow from start
              to finish.

        <p className='subHeader'>Part 1 - Explore Ideas</p>
        <p className='ingressParagraph'>
          The first part of the discovery research was to choose a problem to
          solve with food consumption. I decided to focus on{' '}
          <span className='bold'>food waste </span> because according to the
          Swedish National Food Administration:
        </p>
        <div className='uxProjectWrapperYellow'>
          <div className='uxProjectContainer'>
            <p className='posItText'>
              Approximately 19 kilos of edible food are thrown in the rubbish
              and 26 kilos of food and drink are poured into the bin. The
              figures apply per person and year.{' '}
              <span className='bold'>
                Much of the food is thrown away because it is not eaten in time.
              </span>
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p className='MiddleIngressParagraph'>
          So after exploring different ideas of how to{' '}
          <span className='bold'>help the user waste less food </span> I decided
          to{' '}
          <span className='bold'>
            create an app that gives the user a reminder when their purchased
            food will soon expire.
          </span>{' '}
          So in other words:
        </p>
        <div className='uxProjectWrapperBlue'>
          <div className='uxProjectContainer'>
            <p className='posItText'>
              We want to make it easier for the user to eat their purchased food
              before it expires, and in this way{' '}
              <span className='bold'>save money</span> and at the same time
              <span className='bold'> protect the environment.</span>
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p className='subHeader'>The main two features of this app would be:</p>

        <div className='postItContainer'>
          <div className='postItNotes'>
            <h2 className='postItTitle'> Register</h2>
            <p className='postItText'>
              Register the food in the app and put a best-before date on it.

          </div>
          <div className='postItNotes'>
            <h2 className='postItTitle'>Reminder </h2>
            <p className='postItText'>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p className='MiddleIngressParagraph'>
          That's the basic idea of the app and the two main features. With that
          in mind the next step of the discovery was to do a competitor
          analysis.

            <h1>Easy to use</h1>
            <p>
              The app needs to have a clean and simple interface and approach.
              Not just because of a smooth user experience, but also because it
              has to do with food, so the UI needs to be clean.
            </p>

          <div className='insightsContainer'>
            <h1>Easy to register date</h1>
            <p>
              Scanning a food item don't work well, according to the competitor
              analysis, so it's better to manually register items, but how? This
              is the most important feature of the app so it needs to be easy
              and quick to do.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className='insightsContainer'>
            <h1>Be able to categorize items</h1>
            <p>
              To more easily find a specific food item in the App and at home.
              Some user might have an extra fridge or storage, so all items are
              not in the same place. That makes this app an inventory of your
              food items, which brings more value to the user.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p className='ingressParagraph'>
          That's the discovery part of the analysis with lots of interesting
          information. I feel the outlines of an app is starting to take shape.
          Some of the more interesting insights was e.g that it's not just an
          app to keep track of your foods expiration date, but also an inventory
          space/cloud of your storages. So the features and value of the app is
          expanding because of the research of competitors and target group. Now
          it's time to define these insights and se what they really mean.
